## Tasks performed:

> I first created a repo and cloned it to my local computer using the Terminal.  I then created a directory with an index.html and style.css file, a folder with 
images, and READ.me file.

> Using the mock-up provided as an example, I first created a wireframe to guide my layout.  I then made the document structure using semantic HTML5 elements, with a header, nav, multiple sections, an aside, and a footer.  I then styled the elements using CSS3 selectors, focusing primarily on flexbox for the positioning.  I used pseudo-classes, box styling, and custom fonts learned the previous week and added the Reset.css file.  After my website was complete, I cleaned up the CSS file and consolidated the unnecessary styles, and commented on several sections that needed explanation.  

> I added three media queries for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile and styled the website appropriately to be optimized for these layouts.
